Secure Password Encryption/Decryption: Engineered a robust application in C++ leveraging a shift cipher for symmetric encryption and decryption of passwords.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilized OOP principles to design a modular class structure for user authentication, encapsulating user credentials and related operations.

MySQL Database Integration: Integrated MySQL for persistent storage and retrieval of encrypted passwords, employing secure SQL queries to safeguard sensitive user data.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Developed an interactive CLI in C++ that allows users to securely sign up and log in, incorporating robust error handling and input validation without the need for a graphical user interface.
